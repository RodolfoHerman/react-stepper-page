# Attachments Viwer (Visualizador de anexos)

Component made in Reactjs to perform visualizations of attachments to be uploaded by the user. The visualization is done inside a carousel in a modal, allowing the user to change pages (when the file has more than one). The viewer allows you to control the number of files to be uploaded, in addition there is a control of allowed extensions, which at the moment are:

- PDF
- Imagens (You can add other types)
  - jpg
  - jpeg
  - png
  - tiff
